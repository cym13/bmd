Description
===========

Simple command line bookmark and/or tagging utility.

In order to help using it to tag files and directories as well as urls, it
recognises if the URL given is that of an existing file. If so, the absolute
path is substituted to help scripting by piping the output and to escape
ambiguity. This behaviour can be stopped by using the "--no-path-subs" option.

One way to see this program is to consider it a simple hashmap utility for
bash that associates a set of strings (the tags) to another one (the url).
Feel free to find other ways to use this program!


This is a clone from 'bookmark' (http://github.com/cym13/bookmark) that uses
redis instead of relying on files to speed up the process (by about 4 times).

The original one could have be rewritten to use redis, but I did not wanted
to annoy the users and I wanted to improve at D.


THIS VERSION IS NOT STABLE YET (but usable).
